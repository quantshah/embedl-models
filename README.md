# Embedl models

Optimized AI models for the edge by [Embedl](https://www.embedl.com/).

## Installation

The package provides optimized models for the edge and can be installed with
```
pip install embedl-models
```

## Models

## FlashHead - efficient langugage models head

Optimized versions of langugage models using FlashHead, Embedl’s efficient
replacement for the traditional language-model head. FlashHead drastically
reduces size while preserving accuracy, enabling H200-level latency on consumer
GPUs (RTX Ada generation).

This model is designed for low-latency inference on NVIDIA RTX GPUs, using a
combination of:
- FlashHead
- Mixed-precision quantization (W4A16)
- Custom vLLM generation

FlashHead produces outputs that match the baseline models within rounding error
on standard evaluations (MMLU-Pro, HellaSwag, GSM8K etc.). Overall, this model
is capable of yielding H200-level latency on consumer-grade GPUs (RTX Ada).

### Usage

The recommended way to use FlashHead is vLLM with the custom generation
pipeline provided in this package.

A simple chat interface can be launched as follows that serves an OpenAI
compatible server at http://localhost:8000/v1/completions:
```
python -m embedl.models.vllm.cli serve embedl/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-FlashHead --max_model_len 2048 --trust-remote-code
vllm chat
```

## Roadmap

The following improvements are planned for upcoming releases:

- HuggingFace transformers pipeline
- Benchmarking via vLLM CLI (for detailed latency benchmarking)
- Support for lm-eval-harness (for detailed accuracy measurements)
- Upstream support of models in transformers and vllm
- Compatibility with GGUF, MLC, Llama.cpp, TGI etc.
- Support for additional inference toolchains and devices
